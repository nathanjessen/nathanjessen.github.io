# NathanJessen.github.io

My (old) personal website and blog.

My portfolio has moved to a NextJS implementation.

## Development

This site uses Jekyll with Docker for local development. This approach eliminates the need to install Ruby and gems directly on your machine.

### Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 20 or higher)
- npm (version 10 or higher)

### Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/nathanjessen/nathanjessen.github.io.git
   cd nathanjessen.github.io
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   The site will be available at http://localhost:4000 with live reload enabled.

4. To stop the server:
   ```bash
   npm run stop
   ```

### Available Commands

- `npm run dev` or `npm start` - Start the development server with Docker
- `npm run stop` - Stop the development server
- `npm run clean` - Stop the server and remove volumes
- `npm run build:dev` - Build the site with development settings
- `npm run build` or `npm run build:production` - Build the site for production
- `npm run watch` - Run Gulp watch for CSS processing

## Issues

If you discover a bug, [report it here](https://github.com/nathanjessen/nathanjessen.github.com/issues) or even better, edit and send a pull-request with the fix.

## Build Process

The build process uses Gulp and handles:

* Compiling Tailwind CSS
* Processing CSS with PostCSS:
  * Importing CSS files with `postcss-import`
  * Running Tailwind's JIT engine
  * Adding vendor prefixes with Autoprefixer
  * Minifying CSS with cssnano in production
* Running Jekyll for static site generation
* Live reloading during development with Jekyll's built-in server

## What is Tailwind?

>"Tailwind is a utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom user interfaces."

## What is Jekyll?

Jekyll is a static site generator. It takes text written in your favorite markup language and uses layouts to create a static website. You can tweak the site's look and feel, URLs, the data displayed on the page, and more.
